			<h2>The Best Pizza in Brooklyn</h2>
			<p>
				Now found exclusively at one well-known pizza garden in<br />
				Gravesend, Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found in<br />
				neighborhood bakeries. This pizza is deceivingly light,
				crisp,<br />
				and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a can of soda.

			<h2>Directions:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>
						Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand
						mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast
						mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until
						yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5
						minutes.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough
						into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in
						the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise
						until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl
						to make sauce.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet
						generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom.
						Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella
						cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce.
						Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle
						remaining olive oil over pizza.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>
						Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven
						until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15
						to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before
						slicing into squares.
