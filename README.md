# Assignment

## Iteration 1: Initial structure
1. Within the `odin-recipes` directory, create an `index.html` file.
2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an `h1` heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page
1. Within the `odin-recipes` directory, create a new directory and name it `recipes`.
2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain.<br>
For example `lasagna.html`. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration,<br>
you can find a recipe to use here: https://www.allrecipes.com/
3. For now, just include an `h1` heading with the recipe's name as its content.
4. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created.<br>
The text of the lilnk should again be the recipe name.
