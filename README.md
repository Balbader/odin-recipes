# Assignment

## Iteration 1: Initial structure
1. Within the `odin-recipes` directory, create an `index.html` file.<br>
2. Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an `h1` heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

## Iteration 2: Recipe Page
1. Within the `odin-recipes` directory, create a new directory and name it `recipes`.<br>
2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain.<br>
For example `lasagna.html`. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration,<br>
you can find a recipe to use here: https://www.allrecipes.com/ <br>
3. For now, just include an `h1` heading with the recipe's name as its content.<br>
4. Back in the `index.html` file, add a link to the recipe page you just created.<br>
The text of the lilnk should again be the recipe name.

## Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
The recipe page should have the following content:<br>
1. An image of the finished dish under the h1 heading that you added earlier.<br>
You can find images of the dish on google or the site recipe site we linked to earlier.<br>
2. Under the image, it should habe an appropriately sized "Description" heading followed<br>
by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.<br>
3. Under the description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed<br>
by un **unordered list** of the ingredients needed for the recipe.<br>
4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" heading followed by an<br>
**ordered list** of the steps needed for making the dish.

## Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
1. Add two more recipes with identical page structures to the recipe page you've<br>
already created.<br>
2. Don't forget to link the new recipes on the index page. Also, consider putting<br>
all the links in an unordered lilst so they aren't all on one line.
